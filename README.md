# fit-bi-ag1
AG1 course at FIT CTU. This repository contains my solutions to the homework assignments.

## Assignment 1 - DFS [10/10]
Turned out to be pretty simple. 

## Assignment 2 - AVL Tree [2,5/10]
I made a ton of tests but I didn't figure out what's wrong with my code. It seems to work but I didn't pass all the internal tests on the Progtest site.

## Assignment 3 - Minimum spanning tree [10/10]
I used the Jarnik algorithm to find the minimal spanning tree and then a simple algorithm for the minimum vertex cover of the final spanning tree.
